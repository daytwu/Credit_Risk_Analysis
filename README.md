# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

Our work and practices led us to applying machine learning to credit card risk assessments. Using the dataset from LendingClub, we are to test and evaluate 6 different algorithms to predict credit card risks.

## Results
Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.
## Summary
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
